# Double-Pendulum
Researching the motion of a double pendulum with no air resistance.

This project was initiated and completed in 2017, and presented during the 2017 Bremen Summer School of Mathematics.

## Images
The images are in ASCII ppm format. You can use GIMP or Photoshop to view them. I also recommend the website http://paulcuth.me.uk/netpbm-viewer/, which is a simple netBPM viewer.
The filename format is: image[x-res]x[y-res]\_[max number of steps]\_[enery error in sci. notation]\_

So, for example, image300x300_250_1e-1_ is a 300x300 ppm image, where for each pixel the pendulum motion is generated until either 250 steps or a pendulum-flip occurs. The step size is 1\*10^-1, or .1 seconds.
